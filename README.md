# Chicken Game
### Made by Jiwon Yu and David Yang

a racing game on p5.js between two characters, chicken and penguin, which would race to the finish line. These characters would be controlled by the movement of the elbow in real life, where an Arduino on a breadboard would be attached to each player's arm.
